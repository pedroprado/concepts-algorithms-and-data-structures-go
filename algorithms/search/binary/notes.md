# Binary Search

It is an algorithm that searchs in a ORDERED collection.

Divide and conquer.

If a given element if GREATER than the element in the MIDDLE, discart the left portion of the collection.

If a given element if LESS than the element in the MIDDLE (or equals to), discart the right portion of the collection.


## Time Complexity

Best case: O(1)  (first element of the collection)

Average/Worst case: O(log(n))
