# Merge Sort 

It uses the "divde and conquer" strategy

Generally, it uses recursion to solve.

It relies on the fact that "a collection of one element is already sorted"

It divides the collection of size N, to N collections of size 1, reorders and merges them to the original collection

## Time Complexity

Best case: O(n*log(n))  

Average/Worst case: O(n*log(n))

## Space Complexity

O(n): it needs to hold the smaller arrays in memory for sorting
