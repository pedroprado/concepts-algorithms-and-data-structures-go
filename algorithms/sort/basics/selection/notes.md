# Selection Sort 

It is an algorithm that pulls the lower value to the beginning of the collection.

For each iteration, it compares "two by two" elements looking for the lower one.

At the end of the iteration, the lowest value element is pulled to the beginning of the collection.

## Time Complexity

Best case: O(n)  (collection is sorted)

Average/Worst case: O(n^2)

## Space Complexity

O(1): the collection should not be mutated (only the indexes)
