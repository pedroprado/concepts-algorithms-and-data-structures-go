# Insertion Sort 

Algorithm that builds a sorted list gradually. 

It takes one element from the "sorting collection" and finds its place in a "sorted collection"

Efficient when the collection is ALMOST SORTED

## Time Complexity

Best case: O(n)  (collection is sorted)

Average/Worst case: O(n^2)

## Space Complexity

O(1): the collection should not be mutated (only the indexes)
