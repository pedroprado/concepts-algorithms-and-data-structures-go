# Bubble Sort 

It is an algorithm that pushes the higher value element to the right

For each iteration, it compares two elements looking for the higher one

## Time Complexity

Best case: O(n)  (collection is sorted)

Average/Worst case: O(n^2)

## Space Complexity

O(1): the collection should not be mutated (only the indexes)
