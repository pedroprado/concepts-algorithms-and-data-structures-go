# Bubble Sort 

It is an algorithm that pushes the higher value element to the right.

For each iteration, it compares "two by two" elements looking for the higher one, and pushing the highest to the right. 

At the end of the iteration, the highest element is in the last position of the collection.

## Time Complexity

Best case: O(n)  (collection is sorted)

Average/Worst case: O(n^2)

## Space Complexity

O(1): the collection should not be mutated (only the indexes)
